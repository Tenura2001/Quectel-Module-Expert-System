## 🧩 Core Domain Idea  

The system’s intelligence lies in **expert rule-based reasoning** — a concept from Artificial Intelligence used in decision-support systems.  

- The **Knowledge Base** stores domain facts (Quectel modules, specs, and ideal conditions).  
- The **Inference Engine** applies rules derived from domain expertise to find suitable matches.  
- The **Explanation System** provides reasoning behind each recommendation.  

This aligns with **AI’s Knowledge Representation** domain — where expert systems emulate human domain specialists.
